# DADS 7305 - MLOps

## Overview

Welcome to the MLOps Repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing reading contents, labs and exercises for the MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) course at Northeastern University. The primary goal of this repository is to provide a centralized platform for students, instructors, and anyone interested in MLOps to access and collaborate on course-related materials. You can learn more on Machine learning topics by watching my videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCGbsdfmgmhMLs-tjOtOp0Q) or visit my [Website](https://www.mlwithramin.com/).

## Introduction

MLOps is an emerging discipline that focuses on the collaboration and communication of both data scientists and IT professionals while automating and streamlining the machine learning lifecycle. It bridges the gap between machine learning development and production deployment, ensuring that machine learning models are scalable, reproducible, and maintainable. This repository serves as a resource hub for students and instructors of Northeastern University's MLOps course.

## Course Description

The MLOps course at Northeastern University is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the MLOps field. Throughout the course, students will learn how to:

- Build end-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Deploy machine learning models to production
- Monitor and maintain ML systems
- Implement CI/CD/CM/CT (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment/Continuous Monitoring/Continuous Training) for ML
- Containerize and orchestrate ML workloads
- Handle data drift and model retraining
- **Apply LLMOps practices to large language models (LLMs), including evaluation, alignment, monitoring, deployment, and lifecycle management**

This repository hosts the labs, code samples, and documentation related to these topics.

## Labs Content

This repository offers a series of hands-on labs designed to enhance your understanding of MLOps and LLMOps concepts. Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of the machine learning lifecycle, providing practical experience with tools and methodologies essential for deploying and managing both traditional ML models and modern LLMs in production environments.  

Students will gain hands-on experience with:

- Containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines  
- ML model monitoring, retraining, and handling data drift  
- **LLMOps labs for evaluation, monitoring, alignment, and responsible AI practices**  
- Deployment strategies for large language models at scale  

Each lab is accompanied by detailed instructions and code examples to facilitate hands-on learning. It's recommended to follow the labs sequentially, as concepts build upon each other. For additional resources and support, refer to the [Reading Materials](./Labs/Reading%20Materials) section of this repository.
